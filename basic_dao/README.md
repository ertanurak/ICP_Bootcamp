# DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

This repository contains a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) implemented as an actor in the Motoko programming language. The DAO facilitates decentralized governance by allowing users to create, vote on, and execute proposals. 

## Overview

The DAO actor provides functionalities for managing user accounts, submitting proposals, voting on proposals, and executing accepted proposals. Each user account holds a balance of tokens, which can be transferred between accounts or used for voting on proposals. Proposals contain information about actions to be executed, such as calling methods on canister IDs. 

## Features

- **Account Management:** Users can create accounts and check their token balances.
- **Proposal Submission:** Users can submit proposals containing actions to be executed by the DAO.
- **Voting:** Users can vote on proposals to determine their approval.
- **Proposal Execution:** Accepted proposals are executed by the DAO to perform specified actions.

## Example Usage

```motoko
import DAO "canister:dao";

actor {
  // Initialize the DAO
  let dao = DAO.DAO(initialStorage);

  // Transfer tokens between accounts
  let transferResult = dao.transfer(transferArgs);

  // Submit a proposal
  let proposalResult = dao.submitProposal(proposalPayload);

  // Vote on a proposal
  let voteResult = dao.vote(voteArgs);

  // Get system parameters
  let systemParams = dao.getSystemParams();
}
```
## Installation

To use the DAO actor in your Motoko project, you need to include it as a dependency. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the DAO repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

1) Add Dependency: Add the DAO actor as a dependency in your project's dfx.json file.
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dao": {
      "path": "path/to/dao"
    }
  }
}
Replace "path/to/dao" with the path to the DAO directory relative to your project.

2) Import DAO: Import the DAO actor in your Motoko source files to use its functionalities.
import DAO "canister:dao";

3) Usage: Now you can use the DAO actor's functionalities in your project as needed.
