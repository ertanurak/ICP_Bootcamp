# ICP Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to the ICP Bootcamp Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects developed during the bootcamp sessions, all utilizing the Motoko programming language.

## Projects

- **[calculator]**
  Description: This repository contains an Actor Calculator project implemented in Motoko. The Actor Calculator is a simple calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all implemented using asynchronous functions in the Motoko programming language.

- **[phoneBook]**
  Description: This repository contains a simple phone book application implemented in Motoko. The Motoko Phone Book allows users to insert new entries and lookup existing entries by name.

- **[toDo]**
  Description: This repository contains a basic to-do list application implemented in Motoko. The Motoko To-Do List enables users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view all tasks in the list.

- **[superhero]**
  Description: This repository contains a simple actor named "Superheroes" for managing superhero data. The actor provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete superhero data.

- **[exponantiation]**
  Description: This repository contains an actor named "Exponentiation" written in the Motoko programming language. The actor is designed to efficiently calculate exponentiation operations. It offers functionalities to set the base number and compute the exponentiation result for a given exponent using query functions.
  
- **[token_transfer]**
  Description: This code snippet defines an actor responsible for transferring tokens between accounts using the ICRC1 ledger canister. The actor provides a "transfer" function that facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another. It handles various parameters such as the amount to transfer, the recipient account, and transaction metadata. Additionally, error handling is implemented to manage any potential transfer failures or exceptions. Overall, this actor simplifies the process of token transfers within the ICRC1 ledger canister environment.

- **[basic_dao]**
  Description: The Basic DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a Motoko smart contract designed for managing token transfers, proposal submissions, voting, and system parameter updates within a decentralized network. It offers a straightforward framework for participants to engage in governance activities such as proposing, voting on, and executing changes to the network's parameters and functionalities.

## Motoko Programming Language

All projects in this repository are written in Motoko. Motoko is a modern programming language developed specifically for building scalable and efficient smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps) on the Internet Computer platform. It offers powerful features and abstractions that simplify the development process while ensuring security and performance.

For more information about Motoko, visit the [official documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html).
