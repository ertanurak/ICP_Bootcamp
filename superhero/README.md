# Superheroes Actor

## Project Description

The Superheroes Actor project is a Motoko-based implementation for managing superhero data. It provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete superhero records. This project serves as an example of building distributed applications using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and demonstrates key concepts such as actors, data types, and state management in Motoko programming.

## Overview

The project consists of an actor named "Superheroes" that encapsulates the functionality for managing superhero data. It includes data types for representing superhero identifiers and attributes, high-level API functions for interacting with the actor, and utility functions for handling data operations.

## How to Use

To use the Superheroes Actor in your Motoko project, follow these steps:

1. Import the required Motoko standard library modules.
2. Instantiate the "Superheroes" actor in your application code.
3. Use the provided high-level API functions to perform CRUD operations on superhero data.
4. Compile your Motoko code and deploy it to the Internet Computer platform.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Superheroes Actor in your Motoko code:

```motoko
// Instantiate the Superheroes actor
let superheroesActor = Superheroes();

// Create a new superhero
let superheroId = await superheroesActor.create({ name = "Superman"; superpowers = [ "Flight", "Strength", "Heat Vision" ] });

// Read the superhero data
let superheroData = await superheroesActor.read(superheroId);

// Update the superhero data
let updatedSuperheroData = { name = "Batman"; superpowers = [ "Intelligence", "Martial Arts", "Utility Belt" ] };
await superheroesActor.update(superheroId, updatedSuperheroData);

// Delete the superhero
let isDeleted = await superheroesActor.delete(superheroId);
```

## Data Types

SuperheroId: Represents the identifier of a superhero.
